Moumita - My newest hobby is driving after clearing my driving license exam recently. Getting control over the steering is something very excited. I do not prefer music while driving, maybe I will get accustomed to it later once I am more skilled in my hobby. I am yet to gain full confidence, so I need my husband beside me :D. I have started driving short distances, hoping to complete a longer journey soon.

My hobbies are reading books, working out. Along with this, I like spending time in nature, Playing a guitar & listening to Music, Cooking.
